	<p>PG is a Generator based on

		. If you don&#39;t want to use PG give another Generator just a try. To cut the matter short:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>PG helps you to kickstart new and complex projects in a few minutes.</li>
		<li>PG uses
			<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>
			as Task Runner.
		</li>
		<li>PG uses
			<a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>
			as Web Package Manager.
		</li>
		<li>Pg uses
			<a href="http://assemble.io/">Assemble</a>
			as Template Engine.
		</li>
	</ul>
